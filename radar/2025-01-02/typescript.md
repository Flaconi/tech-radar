[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a language that gets transpiled to native JavaScript code.
It is a superset of JavaScript and adds static typing to the language. This makes it easier to catch errors.
It is currently used in all our Node.js projects and is the preferred language for new projects.
