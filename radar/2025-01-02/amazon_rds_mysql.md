[Amazon RDS for MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql) is an easy to manage relational database optimized for total cost of ownership.
We only use it for some projects where we need a relational database and do not want to manage the database ourselves.
For new projects always a managed database should be used, but the choice between Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB should be made based on the requirements of the project.
