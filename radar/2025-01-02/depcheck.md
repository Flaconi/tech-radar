[Depcheck](https://github.com/depcheck/depcheck) is a tool for analyzing the dependencies in a project to see: how each dependency is used, which dependencies are useless, and which dependencies are missing from package.json. 
You can run it as part of your [continuous integration pipeline](https://github.com/Flaconi/nodejs-api-lambda-boilerplate/blob/master/package.json#L8).
