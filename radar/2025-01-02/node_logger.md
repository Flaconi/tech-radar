[Node Logger](https://github.com/Flaconi/lib-logger/tree/master/packages/node-logger) is a sharded library and wrapper around 
[winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston). It contains best practices for logging in our backend services and also
a fingers crossed logger. It should be used in all projects that are written in Node.js.
