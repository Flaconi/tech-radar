To mitigate the bus factor and enhance the diversity of contributors to our
projects, we made the strategic decision to remove Haskell from our technology
stack. While Haskell's characteristics—such as its strictness, laziness, and
purity—have undeniably contributed to make invalid states in our software
unrepresentable, its steep learning curve is a well-recognized challenge that
may discourage developers from engaging deeply with a project.
