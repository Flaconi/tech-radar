[Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) is a serverless, NoSQL, fully managed database with single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
We use it for projects where we need a NoSQL database and do not want to manage the database ourselves.
For new projects always a managed database should be used, but the choice between Amazon RDS and Amazon DynamoDB should be made based on the requirements of the project.
