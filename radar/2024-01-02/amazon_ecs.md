[Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)  is a fully managed container orchestration service that 
helps you to more efficiently deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.
Currently, we are using it in a small amount of projects. We are still evaluating the service and its benefits for our use cases.
We see a potential to use it as a replacement for costly lambda functions in some projects.
