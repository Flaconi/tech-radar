To accelerate the implementation of a functioning ISMS, we are adopting [Vanta](https://www.vanta.com) as a compliance automation tool. It helps continuously monitor key controls (encryption, access, risk), automate evidence collection, and enforce system security baselines.

Vanta will be a core part of our technical ISMS foundation, supporting our compliance with the P7S1 Information Security Directive, ISO 27001, and the upcoming NIS2 regulation. By integrating with our infrastructure, identity systems, and development workflows, it enables continuous compliance monitoring and reduces manual audit effort across the organization.
